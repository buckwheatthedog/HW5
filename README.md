a. what line of code waits one and a half seconds?

delay(1500); 

b. why does a resistor need an LED?

To limit the "choke", the amount of current flowing through the LED to prevent it from burning out. 

c. why is a breadboard useful?

It allows you to prototype circuits quickly, without having to commit to soldering them. 

d. Identtify at least 2 things you didnt understand from the reading. 

1. Why is the term ground used, when the arduino and it's various actuators are not physically connected to the earth. What is the correct term to use and how should one think about the term "ground" practically for electronics prototyping?

2. In the example of the servo motor, why does drawing a lot of power suddenly result in a drop of power in the arduino and subsequent resetting? How would one design against this?
